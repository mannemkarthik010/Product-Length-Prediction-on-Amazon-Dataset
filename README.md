# 📦 Product Length Prediction Project

This project focuses on understanding product data and building a machine learning model to **predict the length of a product** using data analysis and machine learning techniques.  
It includes two Jupyter notebooks: one for data exploration and one for prediction modeling.

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**
This notebook helps us understand the dataset through:
- Loading and previewing data  
- Handling missing or incorrect values  
- Cleaning and preparing the data  
- Visualizing data using charts (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)  
- Studying relationships between different features  
- Identifying patterns that influence product length  

**Goal:**  
To gain insights from the dataset before building a prediction model.

### **2. Product_Length_Predition.ipynb**
This notebook contains the machine learning workflow:
- Data preprocessing  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  
- Training different ML models  
- Evaluating performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²  
- Selecting the best-performing model  
- Understanding which features affect product length the most  

**Goal:**  
To build an accurate model that predicts product length.
